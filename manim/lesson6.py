The operations of nqueuing and dequeuing take O(1) time, and so the total time devoted to queue operations is O(V). Because the procedure scans the adjacency list of each vertex only when the vertex is dequeued, it scans each adjacency list at most once. Since the sum of the lengths of all the adjacency lists is E, the total time spent in scanning adjacency lists is O(E). The overhead for initialization is O(V), and thus the total running time of the BFS procedure is O(V + E).
